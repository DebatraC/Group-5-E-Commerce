# Customer Segmentation Analysis - Streamlit Application

A comprehensive web application for customer segmentation analysis using K-means clustering on e-commerce smartphone data.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Multiple Clustering Approaches
- **Visit-Based Clustering**: Segment users based on website visit frequency
- **Price-Based Clustering**: Group users by average purchase price behavior
- **Price-Event Clustering**: Combined analysis of price patterns and event types
- **Brand-Event Clustering**: Clustering based on brand preferences and interaction types
- **Advanced Behavior Clustering**: Comprehensive analysis using visit frequency, conversion ratios, and brand diversity

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Analysis
- Real-time clustering with adjustable parameters
- Elbow method visualization for optimal cluster selection
- Interactive plotly charts and visualizations
- Detailed cluster profiling and business insights
- Comprehensive data overview and statistics

### ðŸ’¡ Business Intelligence
- Automated cluster profiling with business-relevant names
- Actionable recommendations for each customer segment
- Correlation analysis between user behavior features
- Distribution analysis of key metrics

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd customer-segmentation-streamlit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Data Setup
Ensure your data file `mytestdata.parquet` is in the parent directory:
```
Group-5-E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation/
â”œâ”€â”€ mytestdata.parquet                    # Your processed data file
â”œâ”€â”€ customer-segmentation-streamlit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.py                       # Main application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 4. Run the Application
```
streamlit run src/app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Features

- Load and preprocess customer data from various formats (CSV, Parquet).
- Perform K-means clustering on customer visit data.
- Visualize clustering results with histograms, scatter plots, and cluster distributions.
- Calculate and display clustering performance metrics such as silhouette scores and inertia.
